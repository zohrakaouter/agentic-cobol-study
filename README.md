# Coding Agents Can Develop COBOL Systems — study hub

Companion repository for the multi-case empirical study **“Coding Agents Can Develop COBOL Systems”** (2026): 16 non-trivial COBOL systems developed from
scratch by two frontier coding agents (Claude Code and Codex CLI) across 8
domain families, each family implemented by **both** agents (paired runs shared goals or
replay specifications to varying degrees). Validation evidence ranges from
independent differential checks and known values (differential execution
against GnuCOBOL, rated tournaments, cross-solver checks, byte-identical
replays) to property tests, demonstrations, and source inspection, and its
independence and coverage vary by system.

This hub contains the **analysis pipeline, derived datasets, session
material, and reproducible tables/figures**. Each system lives in its own
repository (below), preserved as the agent produced it.

System identifiers follow `FAMILY-COBOL-AGENT`. The repositories keep their
original folder/repo names, which key every artifact in `output/`.

## Identifier-to-folder mapping

The paper refers to systems by canonical identifiers. The released material
under `output/` (session logs, derived measurements and reports, replay packs)
is organized by the historical working-folder names of the sessions, which
are frozen provenance: the raw session logs and the per-session derived
artifacts embed them.

Excluded or superseded attempts keep their original folder names:
`chess-revisit-java-toCOBOL`, `cobol-compress-cc` (the C-only compression
attempt; not to be confused with the GitHub repository of
`COMPRESS-COBOL-CLAUDE`, which carries the same name), `cobol-jb` (an earlier
single-agent payroll attempt, superseded by the payroll pair), `cobol-doom`,
`cobol-SAT`, `cobol-vibes`, and `test-cline-COBOL`.

## What is in this repository

- `scripts/` — the full analysis pipeline (`run_all.sh`, 8 stages: session
  parsing, per-turn SE-task classification, COBOL construct extraction,
  backlog harvesting, per-system metrics, difficulty index, reports).
  `session_roles.py` documents the deterministic development-vs-analyst
  session filter; `system_names.py` maps repository folders to system IDs.
- `output/` — committed derived artifacts: `sessions_all.json`, per-turn
  event streams (`turns/`), per-system metrics, complexity and git stats,
  difficulty index, cost metrics, reports, assessments, and the archived raw
  session logs (`raw_sessions/`, with `MANIFEST.csv`).
- `figures/`, `tables/` — the generated figures (PDF) and LaTeX tables, with
  `scripts/make_figures.py` and `scripts/gen_appendix_tables.py` to
  regenerate them from `output/`.
- `pilots/` — three motivating pilot sessions on non-frontier stacks
  (OpenCode with Gemma 4 and Qwen 3.6-plus, vibe with mistral-medium-3.5),
  logs and artifacts.
- `replications/` — the runbook and the externally authored six-step payroll
  protocol used for the canonical replications.
- `REPORT.md` — the generated top-level analysis report.

## Reproducing

Every number in the study reproduces from the committed artifacts:

```bash
bash scripts/run_all.sh          # stages 2+ re-run from committed inputs
python3 scripts/make_figures.py  # regenerates figures/ from output/
```

**Frozen inputs**: `output/sessions_all.json` and `output/turns/` are frozen.
18 of 38 study-relevant raw session logs were deleted by the agent CLI's
30-day local retention before archiving (20 survive). Re-running stage 1
would silently rebuild from the surviving raw logs only. The archived survivors are in
`output/raw_sessions/`. See the study's data-provenance appendix.

## Replay packs

Each system repository ships its replay pack (`REPLAY_PROMPTS.md` or
equivalent): the opening prompt with the COBOL-boundary constraint, expected
deliverables, and oracles per activity, so a third agent can be run
activity-by-activity against the same specifications.
